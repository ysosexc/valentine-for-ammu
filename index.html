        "hi ammu. i just wanted to try something new this time and i hope you like it. it was a lot of code and i had to start from scratch to understand how webdev works. i love you amidst the storm and whenever you're away too. you deserve for things to work out for you in the end and id always watch you succeed from afar. things must seem hard, but it will pass okay? you got this big girl. you're really almost there, so there is no turning back now. be safe, healthy and strong and may your visions come to life <3 mwa, your boy. (/man ;))"
